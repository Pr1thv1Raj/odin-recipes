    <h1>Chole Bhature</h1>
    <img src="../cholebhature.jpeg" alt="chole bhature">
    <p>Chole bhature is not a single word. It is an emotion. Chole means chickpeas of the best caliber whereas bhature or bhatura 
        (singular Bhatura) is fried puffy dough. This is the leading cause of cholestrol imbalance in India.
